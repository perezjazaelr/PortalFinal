                    <p>Last year’s champions, Remelyn Cinco, Karen Llanes, and Yrral Salazar, made a return performance after winning the 1st Elite Electronics Showdown last year. This year, the group finished as the first runner-up against the University of the East—Caloocan. On the 2nd ECE Math Olympiad, Bryan Roy Raagas, Epsilon Omni Yambot, and Kirby Dengel Alvior likewise finished second, trailing the Technological Institute of the Philippines (QC Campus). While prior Math Olympiad champions Charles Christian Dalapo, Marinella Lansang, and Ralph Yrhon Camangon all excelled at the Inter-Scholastic Quiz Show.</p>
                    <p>This will allow quizzers from the 1st Elite Electronics Showdown and Math Olympiad to attend the IECEP National Students Summit in October.
                        Both Engr. John Philip Maramag and Engr. Darius Trance trained the quizzers for the competitions. Congratulations, ECE Quizzers! The university is truly proud of you!</p>

                    <p>Rizal Technological University (RTU), in collaboration with other Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs), has established a consortium with the primary objective of conserving rivers within their respective regions. The formalization of the relationship occurred through the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on September 30, 2023, at Mabalacat City College.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ma. Eugenia M. Yangco, the University President, and Dr. Rodolfo L. Ducut, the Vice President for Finance and Administration (VPFA), represented the university during the MoU signing. The consortium consists of Aklan State University, Bataan Peninsula State University, Benguet State University, Cavite State University, Cebu Normal University, Mabalacat City College, and RTU.</p>
                    <p>Atty. Lily Frieda Macabangun Milla, the Director of the International Affairs Service of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED-IAS); Hon. Pauline Anderson, US Embassy Deputy Director for Public Engagement; and Ms. Christine Catindig of Education USA, were also present during the ceremony.</p>
                    <p>The impetus for this initiative stemmed from the interactions forged at the NAFSA conference held in the United States earlier this year. At this event, Philippine institutions successfully established communication channels with foreign counterparts who expressed a keen interest in engaging in collaborative efforts pertaining to this particular endeavor.</p>
                    <p>The partnership recognizes the need for safeguarding and conserving the nation’s vital river systems. The consortium’s constituent higher education institutions are dedicated to utilizing their resources and expanding their services in order to provide assistance for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The partnership will also facilitate the sharing of resources and infrastructure for the purpose of conducting scientific studies on river ecosystems. Additionally, it seeks to investigate and promote sustainable practices to contribute to water resource conservation.</p>
                    <p>This collaboration extends an invitation to various domestic and foreign educational institutions. Those interested are encouraged to contact the member institutions for further details on the consortium and opportunities for participation.</p>
